# Summary
Ussing chamber is a device used to record the current generated by transepithelial ion transport in biological membranes [@Westerhout2015]. The Ussing chamber device produced by “Scientific Instruments” is provided with a software, Clamp (developed by M. Ing. A. Mund), that produces files having the .cla extension. These files can be imported into Microsoft Excel ®, but the data elaboration is laborious and takes a significant amount of time for the operator. „Sunny.py“, a program written in python language [@Vanrossum2009] converts the .cla files into .xlsx file, utilizing a graphic user interface (GUI, Fig.1, tkinter library [@Lundh1999]). This conversion allows an automatization in data analysis with three major advantages: (1) The programm provides the user a clearly organizied and easy to handle tables with the column labels in the first line followed by the data. This data formatting enables direct transfer  into R scripts [@R2021] for further analysis and visualization (2) in addition the intervals of drugs administration are reported in a specific column, enhancing the operators overview on experiment workflow (3) The programm claculates the electric impedance as difference of the electric intensity per square centimeter of biological tissue ($\Delta$ I*sc* [µA/cm^2^]) between two intervals, automatically.

# Statement of need
"Sunny.py" is a program developed to make Ussing chamber data analysis faster and more reliable. By importing the Ussing Chamber data (.cla) direcly into excel the user is confronted with several difficulties: (1) Data are not ordered in a column labels-data manner (2) Application time points are  difficult to identify (3) Intervals between two chemicals administrations are hardly identifiable (4) Basic statistic is not reported (i.e. Isc for each interval). All this converts data processing in a laboriuious, time consuming work and since this work consists of dragging and copying intervals of data, the human error is likely. With Sunny.py there is a completely automatization of this process: everything accompanied with a very intuitive interface.

# Conclusions
This programm allows a considerable improvment in result processing of results obtained by the Ussing chambers running Clamp: (1) Fast data elaboration (2) Minimization fo human error (3) Direct data importation into R scripts. Provided with a point and click interface, it´s easy to handle and accessible also for non programmers, once the work eviroment is set.
