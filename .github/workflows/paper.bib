abstract="The Ussing chamber system is named after the Danish zoologist Hans Ussing, who invented the device in the 1950s to measure the short-circuit current as an indicator of net ion transport taking place across frog skin (Ussing and Zerahn, Acta Physiol Scand 23:110--127, 1951). Ussing chambers are increasingly being used to measure ion transport in native tissue, like gut mucosa, and in a monolayer of cells grown on permeable supports. However, the Ussing chamber system is, to date, not often applied for the investigation of the impact of food bioactives (proteins, sugars, lipids) on health.",
